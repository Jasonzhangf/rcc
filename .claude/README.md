# RCC Modular Architecture Governance Rules

This document provides comprehensive governance rules for the TypeScript modular architecture project (RCC), ensuring consistent development practices and architectural integrity.

## Core Principles

1. **Modular Independence**: Each module is self-contained with clear boundaries
2. **Static Compilation, Dynamic Instantiation**: Modules are statically typed but dynamically created
3. **API Isolation**: Strict control over exposed interfaces
4. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout the system
5. **Centralized Registry**: All modules managed through a single registry

## Rule Enforcement

These rules are enforced through:
- Automated linting rules
- TypeScript configuration restrictions
- Code review checklists
- Pre-commit hooks
- Module validation utilities

---

## Rule Categories

### üìã [Module Architecture Rules](./rules/module-architecture.md)
- Base class inheritance requirements
- Module registration and lifecycle management
- Module categorization and type system
- Interface exposure and API isolation standards

### üîí [API Isolation and Security Rules](./rules/api-isolation.md)
- Proxy-based access control
- Method and property exposure whitelisting
- Internal vs external method separation
- Security boundaries and access control

### üîó [Inter-Module Communication Standards](./rules/inter-module-communication.md)
- Connection management protocols
- Data transfer and validation
- Handshake mechanisms
- Routing and request distribution

### üõ°Ô∏è [Type Safety and Validation Rules](./rules/type-safety.md)
- TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Input validation standards
- Type checking and interface definitions
- Error handling and data integrity

### üöÄ [Development and Deployment Rules](./rules/development-deployment.md)
- Module development workflows
- Testing requirements
- Build and deployment processes
- Code quality standards

## Compliance Framework

### Mandatory Validation Steps

1. **Module Registration Validation**
   - All modules must inherit from BaseModule
   - All modules must be registered with ModuleRegistry
   - All modules must implement required interface methods

2. **Type Safety Validation**
   - Strict TypeScript compilation must pass
   - All public interfaces must have proper type definitions
   - No implicit `any` types allowed

3. **API Isolation Validation**
   - All external module access must go through ApiIsolation
   - Only whitelisted methods can be exposed
   - Internal properties must remain private

4. **Connection Management Validation**
   - All connections must follow established protocols
   - Data transfer must include proper validation
   - Handshake mechanisms must be implemented

## Rule Evolution Process

### Requesting Changes

1. Submit rule change proposals with clear rationale
2. Include impact analysis for existing code
3. Provide migration plans if breaking changes
4. Update associated configuration files

### Implementation Process

1. Update rule documentation
2. Update automation and validation tools
3. Update project templates and examples
4. Communicate changes to development team

### Validation Process

1. All code must pass existing rule validations
2. New rules must be implemented progressively
3. Gradual migration approach for breaking changes
4. Comprehensive testing before enforcement

## Architecture Compliance Checklist

### Before Commit Checklist

- [ ] All new modules inherit from BaseModule
- [ ] All modules are properly registered
- [ ] API isolation is implemented for all module interfaces
- [ ] TypeScript strict compilation passes
- [ ] All validation rules are properly configured
- [ ] Connection management follows established patterns
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] All public interfaces are documented

### Module Lifecycle Checklist

- [ ] Registration: Module type registered with registry
- [ ] Initialization: Module properly initialized
- [ ] Configuration: Validation rules configured
- [ ] Connection: Input/output connections established
- [ ] Operation: Module exchanges data through controlled interfaces
- [ ] Destruction: Resources properly cleaned up

## Violation Handling

### Minor Violations

- Type warnings
- Missing documentation
- Inconsistent naming
- Non-critical validation issues

**Action**: Warning in code review, must be fixed before next major release

### Major Violations

- Missing BaseModule inheritance
- Skipping API isolation
- Direct module access without proxies
- Internal method exposure

**Action**: Block commit, mandatory fix before continuing

### Critical Violations

- Bypassing ModuleRegistry
- Circumventing type safety
- Breaking connection protocols
- Compromising security boundaries

**Action**: Immediate rollback, code freeze, architectural review

## Tool Integration

### Automated Validation

The following tools enforce these rules:

- **TypeScript**: Strict compilation rules
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style rules
- **Custom Validators**: Module compliance checks
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated rule validation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing and validation

### Configuration Files

- `.claude/rules/`: Rule definitions and configurations
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript strict mode and restrictions
- `package.json`: Scripts and quality tools configuration
- `.eslintrc.js`: Code quality and style enforcement

## Project Memory Integration

All architectural decisions and rule changes must be documented in the project memory system following naming conventions:

- Format: `timestamp + date + one-sentence summary`
- Categorization: `governance`, `architecture`, `modules`
- Conflict resolution: Latest entries take precedence
- Discovery: Tagged and indexed for easy retrieval

This governance framework ensures consistent, maintainable, and scalable development of the RCC modular architecture system while providing clear guidance for developers and automated validation of architectural principles.
